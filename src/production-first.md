Production First Metholodgy
=========

We always think about a live system when coding and developing features or building Greenfield

We are pragmatic when doing features, we build enough to meet client needs and what has value in Production


Key areas
---------

Deployability
######
**Can the system be quickly redeployed?**

* Release management/release process/CAB ie. tracking what is live
* Runbooks and KOPs
* Documentation
* Build assets 
* Deployment pipelines
* Infrastructure as code
* Data Backups 
* Databsse migrations
* Disaster Recovery plans and regular tests to check restoration is successful including data backups
* Chaos testing


Security
#######
**Is the system safe from any threats?**
**Are users allowed to 

* Threat monitoring 
* Pen-testing
* DevSecOps
* Secure coding practices 
* OWASP top 10
*
